My Friend Fitness App

Requirement:
Help users to find it easier to:
    1. Track their fitness activities
    2. Stay motivated
    3. Achieve their fitness goals

Main Goal: 
Make the app more enjoyable and effective, focused on reducing clutter and highlight what they want to know in the moment.

UX Principles & Objectives to apply:

- User-Centered Design:
    1. Simplify the home screen layout by reducing visual noise, decluttering unnecessary information, and focusing on the key fitness goals and progress. This would create a clearer and more motivating interface for users.


- Simplicity
    2. Streamline the navigation by implementing a clear and intuitive menu structure, allowing users to easily access features like activity tracking, goal setting, and progress history. This would enhance the overall usability and ease of exploration within the app.

    3. Enhance the visual hierarchy by prioritizing important elements such as the userâ€™s daily activity summary, goal progress, and personalized recommendations. This would help users quickly access the most relevant information.


- Feedback and Response:
    4. Improve the interaction design by introducing clear and intuitive icons and buttons for tracking activities, such as running, cycling, or weightlifting. Providing real-time feedback during activity tracking, such as distance covered or calories burned, would further engage users.

Additionally, two more principles are suggested (to be approved)

- Consistency
    5. Since iconography and colors are introduced in the principle above, the visual language of the rest of the app should be updated as well; color-coding slider bars, using themes for mood sets and speaking the same visual language on text as well would engage users.


- Accessibility:
    6. Ensure accessibility guidelines are followed on visual and voice assistance, such as screen reading compatibility and voice alerts for distance covered, weather changes, etc.
